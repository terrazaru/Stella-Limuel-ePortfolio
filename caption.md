# Fall & Spring Garden Day 2018 Flyer
```Here are flyers that I created for The Parish School's Fall and Spring Garden Day in Houston in 2017 and 2018.

These flyers are colorful and family-friendly. They helped The Parish School to promote their Garden Day event to the students' family and to the public. I am satisfied with how the flyers signify different seasons and activities in gardening.
