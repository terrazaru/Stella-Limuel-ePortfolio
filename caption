Spring Garden Day 2018 Flyer
Here is a flyer that I created for The Parish School's Spring Garden Day in Houston in 2018.

This flyer is colorful and family-friendly. It helped The Parish School to promote their Spring Garden Day event to the students' family and to the public. I am satisfied with how the flyer signifies different activities in gardening.
